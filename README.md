# code-challenges
A repository to upload my solutions to code challenges that I have solved usually in javascript/typescript :zap:

To run the exercises you must go to `package.json` and change the path to the directory where you want to run the code.

Example:
```json
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon",
    "start": "ts-node adventjs/2022/chirstmasGiftWrapping.ts"
  },
```
